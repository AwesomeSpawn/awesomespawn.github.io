# Getting Started - Chassis

In this tutorial, we will explore how to effectively control a robot chassis using the UvuvLib robotics code library. The library provides a `UvuvDrivetrain` class that allows you to control your robot's movement and direction easily. To get started, you'll need to initialize a `UvuvMotorGroup` and then use it to create a drivetrain instance.


## Step 1: Initialize UvuvMotorGroup

First, let's initialize a `UvuvMotorGroup` instance. This class represents a group of motors that you will control collectively. The motors in this class should represent the motors controlling the left and right sides of the chassis. 

    #include "UvuvLib/UvuvMain.h"
    
    //Code for making a motor group here
